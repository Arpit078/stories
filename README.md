# stories
wanted to read some premchand stories on my phone but all websites sucked and i got no kindle! 
## backstory 
so one night my parents were talking about this story "poos ki raat" written by legend premchand. The setting of the story intrigued me, and relating with the 9 degree night in Delhi that time i searched the internet to read that very story. I searched the web got some pdfs in hindi very inconvenient on phone to read. NO EPUBS or MOBI that were readable!!!. got a webpage but the ui sucked. So I threw my quilt and fired up my laptop. created this beautiful epub reader like web app that installs as a progressive web app on mobile phones. you get new premchand stories everyday. there is one theme changing slider. The bookmark button is there to save the page number you left reading at. remeber to bookmark the page before leaving otherwise the page gets refreshed and you lose your position. 
## stopped working on this got bored :{ done some decent.
